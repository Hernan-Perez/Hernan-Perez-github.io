				This project, developed by Delta3 for Toyota Argentina, involved the meticulous recreation of a segment of a real factory environment. 
				<br>
				The operation of this Bridge Crane simulator involves the use of a replica of an authentic Bridge Crane remote control, which is implemented using an Arduino.
				<br>
				As a member of the project team, my responsibilities were primarily centered around two key areas. 
				<br>Firstly, I collaborated closely with a 3D artist to construct and refine the digital scene, ensuring its faithful replication of the actual warehouse setting. This involved attention to detail and a keen understanding of spatial dynamics to create an immersive and accurate representation.
				<br>
				Secondly, my role extended to the development of various exercises tailored to meet the specific requirements outlined by the client. These exercises were designed to serve multiple purposes, including training, evaluations on normal conditions and evaluations while invoking failures. Throughout the project, I engaged in iterative refinement processes, incorporating feedback from the client to ensure the final deliverables aligned with their expectations.
				<br><br>
				The project was made in <b>Unity</b> and tested with <b>HTC Vive Pro 2</b>.
